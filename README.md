### Yolov5_Object_Detection:
This project is an example of Obeject Detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) Version 5.
The README guide is structured to walk you through the following steps, after installation and Cloning YOLOv5.

Part1) Using Pre-trained YOLOv5 Model on COCO Dataset:
In this section, I leverage the pre-trained YOLOv5 model on the COCO dataset. This helps in quickly getting acquainted with the capabilities of the model.

Part2)Training on Custom Dataset:
After familiarizing myself with the pre-trained model, I move on to training it on my own dataset. 

Part3) Building my own Dataset with Roboflow
